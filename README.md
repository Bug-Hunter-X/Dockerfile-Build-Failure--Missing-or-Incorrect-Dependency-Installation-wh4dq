# Dockerfile Build Failure: Missing or Incorrect Dependency Installation

This repository demonstrates a common Dockerfile error related to dependency installation and its solution.

## Bug

The original `Dockerfile` attempts to install Python dependencies, but it contains issues that prevent successful build.

## Solution

The `Dockerfile.fixed` file provides a corrected version with improved dependency management. This ensures successful installation and execution within the Docker container.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Try building the original `Dockerfile` using `docker build -t my-app .`. Observe the build failure.
3. Build the corrected `Dockerfile.fixed` using `docker build -t my-app-fixed .` to see the successful build.

This example emphasizes proper dependency installation practices within Dockerfiles.
